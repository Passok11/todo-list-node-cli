# TODO LIST CLI

> Todo list CLI based on node.js

This is a simple implementation of a todo list base on Node.JS to run and manage your TODO lists directly from the terminal.


## Installation

Steps for installation are as follows:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Locate yourself into the directory.
3. Run the following code:

```sh
npm install
```
Errors related to npm? Or npm not installed?
Head over to ['npmjs.com'](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install npm and Node.js

Windows:
For people who use windows, I suggest the usage of [`cmder`](http://cmder.net/) instead of `cmd.exe`. 


## Usage example

```sh
node index.js
```
